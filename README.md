# dodgers-app1
A simple web app comparing the 1988 Dodgers to the 2020 Dodgers

This is the simplest possible web app using the Dash/Plotly framework. 

To run the application, navigate to the directory containing the app.py file. Run the app with `python app.py` and
visit http://127.0.0.1:8050/ in your web browser to view the app. Close the app with 'ctrl + c'.

The app simply displays a bar plot visualizing the batting average (BA), slugging percentage (SLG), and the
earned run average (ERA) of the 1988 Dodgers and the 2020 Dodgers. The 1988 Dodgers are the last Dodger team to win
the World Series. As of this writing, the 2020 Dodgers are making their way through the MLB postseason. I had
an interest in understanding how the two teams compare accross some basic regular season statistics.

When you run the app and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8050/, you should see something like this.
